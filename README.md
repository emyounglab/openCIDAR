## Plasmid sequences
Sequences and annotations for all plasmids used in this study are provided in the GenBank (.gb) format.

## Flow cytometry analysis
The purpose of this repository is to capture the entire analysis pipeline for flow cytometry experiments performed as part of this study. This analysis can be recreated from raw data (.fcs files) to figures by floowing the steps below.

Experimental procedures are not within the scope of this repository. Experimental procedures are described within the openCIDAR paper (link). Raw data generated by those experiments has been uploaded to FlowRepository with annotations that meet the MIFlowCyt minimum information standard (MIS) described [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/0471142956.cy1018s61).

### Analysis procedure
1. Clone the github repo onto your drive.

1. Download raw data (.fcs files) from [FlowRepository](link).

2. Convert data from arbitrary units to MEFL using FlowCal. Attach relevant metadata and concatenate all events from an experiment into one .csv file.

3. Copy all .csv files into 

3. Read all .csv files from all experiments into the R script
